  "summary": "Yahsat has ordered a pair of LEO satellites from Airbus as part of a $1.1 billion program that also includes two geostationary broadband spacecraft, Al Yah 4 and Al Yah 5. The LEO satellites will be based on Airbus' Arrow platform, derived from OneWeb’s broadband constellation. The GEO satellites are planned for launch in 2027 and 2028 to replace aging satellites and provide government communications across the Middle East, Africa, Europe, and Asia. The UAE government has committed $5.1 billion for broadband services from Yahsat until 2043.",
  "why_it_matters": "This contract strengthens Yahsat’s multi-orbit strategy and expands its satellite fleet with Airbus as a key supplier. The deal also highlights Yahsat’s focus on government and commercial broadband services, supported by a long-term $5.1 billion commitment from the UAE government. The inclusion of LEO satellites marks a diversification from Yahsat’s traditional GEO focus.",
