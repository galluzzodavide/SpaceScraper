  "summary": "A joint venture between Rheinmetall and ICEYE has secured a $1.9 billion contract to build and operate a SAR satellite constellation for Germany's armed forces. The system will provide persistent surveillance and reconnaissance data, focusing on NATO's eastern flank, particularly supporting Germany's brigade in Lithuania. The contract runs through 2030 with extension options and includes satellite production, imagery supply, ground infrastructure management, and analytical services.",
  "why_it_matters": "This deal marks a significant shift toward sovereign military space infrastructure in Europe, reducing reliance on U.S. intelligence assets. It reflects Germany's broader defense modernization efforts post-Russia's invasion of Ukraine and underscores the strategic importance of SAR satellites for military operations in cloud-prone regions like the Baltics.",
