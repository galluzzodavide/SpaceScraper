  "summary": "Iceye has launched a new maritime surveillance product called Ocean Vision, which integrates SAR imagery with complementary data sources like AIS and RF data. The service aims to enhance monitoring of global oceans for activities such as illicit trade, smuggling, and illegal fishing. Iceye also recently launched three new SAR satellites via SpaceX's Transporter-10 mission.",
  "why_it_matters": "The launch of Ocean Vision expands Iceye's capabilities in maritime surveillance, addressing growing demand for ocean monitoring solutions. However, this is a product launch and not a corporate deal or financial event.",
