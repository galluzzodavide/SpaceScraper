  "summary": "BAE Systems is developing a multi-sensor satellite cluster called Azalea, partnering with Finnish company ICEYE to build a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite for the constellation. The cluster will include optical and RF sensors, aiming to provide intelligence for military and disaster response needs. The first cluster is planned for deployment in 2024 via SpaceX, with future clusters expected to increase revisit rates.",
  "why_it_matters": "This partnership strengthens BAE Systems' space capabilities by integrating ICEYE's SAR technology into a sovereign UK cluster, enhancing military and defense intelligence with multi-sensor data fusion. The project highlights the growing trend of multi-sensor satellite constellations for flexible, future-proofed defense applications.",
