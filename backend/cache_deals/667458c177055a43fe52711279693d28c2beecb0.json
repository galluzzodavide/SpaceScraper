  "summary": "Experts at the AFCEA-INSA Intelligence and National Security Summit warn that the U.S. is falling behind in the satellite imaging race due to insufficient government support and bureaucratic stagnation. The commercial remote sensing industry, including companies like Finland's ICEYE, is advancing, but the U.S. military's tactical ISR needs remain unmet. China's rapid deployment of ISR satellites and internal U.S. agency disagreements further complicate the situation.",
  "why_it_matters": "The article highlights the strategic importance of commercial remote sensing satellites for military operations, particularly in tactical ISR. The U.S. risks losing its competitive edge to adversaries like China if it does not increase investment and streamline procurement processes for commercial satellite capabilities.",
