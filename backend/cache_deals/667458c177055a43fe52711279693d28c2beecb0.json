  "summary": "Experts at the AFCEA-INSA Intelligence and National Security Summit warn that the U.S. is falling behind in the satellite imaging race, particularly in meeting military demands for real-time tactical intelligence. The article highlights concerns about insufficient U.S. government funding for commercial remote sensing, China's rapid expansion of ISR satellites, and the need for better integration of commercial capabilities into military operations. ICEYE is mentioned as a foreign competitor with advanced SAR capabilities.",
  "why_it_matters": "The U.S. risks losing its competitive edge in satellite imaging and tactical ISR capabilities, which are critical for military operations and national security. The article underscores the need for increased funding, clearer agency responsibilities, and better integration of commercial satellite data to maintain U.S. leadership in this sector.",
