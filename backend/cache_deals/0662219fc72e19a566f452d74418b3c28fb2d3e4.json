  "summary": "Astronomers have documented concerns about the brightness and potential radio interference of AST SpaceMobile's BlueWalker 3 satellite, which has become one of the brightest objects in the night sky. The company is collaborating with NASA and astronomy groups to mitigate these issues, while the NSF is finalizing coordination agreements with other satellite operators, including Iceye and Planet, to address similar concerns.",
  "why_it_matters": "The article highlights growing concerns about the impact of large commercial satellites on astronomy, particularly their brightness and radio interference. It underscores the need for coordination between satellite operators and the scientific community to mitigate negative effects on observational astronomy.",
