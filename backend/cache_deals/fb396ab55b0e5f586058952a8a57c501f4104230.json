  "summary": "The U.S. government has relaxed export control regulations for certain space technologies but maintained strict controls on high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites. The new rules exclude SAR systems operating above 500MHz bandwidth, which industry leaders like Capella Space and Iceye consider obsolete. This regulatory hurdle may drive international customers toward non-U.S. alternatives like Finland's Iceye, as U.S. companies face competitive disadvantages due to ITAR restrictions.",
  "why_it_matters": "The article highlights the competitive and strategic challenges U.S. SAR satellite companies face due to restrictive export controls, potentially benefiting non-U.S. competitors like Iceye. It underscores the broader geopolitical implications of space technology access and the risk of losing market share to global rivals, including Chinese firms.",
