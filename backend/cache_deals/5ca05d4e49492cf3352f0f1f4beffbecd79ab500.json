  "summary": "The article discusses the current state of space sustainability, highlighting the lack of concrete action and data-driven systems to address debris and coordination challenges. It uses the Intelsat-33E fragmentation event as an example of institutional inaction and calls for a shift toward operational visibility and transparency in 2026.",
  "why_it_matters": "The article underscores the gap between rhetoric and action in space sustainability, emphasizing the need for data, coordination, and persistent monitoring to address debris and operational risks. It critiques the current approach as symbolic rather than systemic.",
