  "summary": "Rhea Space Activity, a space technology startup, is developing autonomous navigation software for military use under a U.S. Space Force contract worth approximately $1.9 million. The project, called Vanguard, adapts NASA-developed AutoNav software to enable GPS-denied navigation and autonomous rendezvous operations in contested orbital environments.",
  "why_it_matters": "The development of GPS-independent navigation technology is critical for military and intelligence missions in contested space environments, where reliance on GPS may be compromised. This contract highlights efforts to enhance satellite resilience and autonomy.",
