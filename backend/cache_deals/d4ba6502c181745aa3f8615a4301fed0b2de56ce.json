  "summary": "Japan’s IHI has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with UK-based SatVu to explore adding thermal imaging satellites to its planned sovereign Earth observation constellation. The partnership aims to evaluate applications of thermal data in Japan, define requirements for a high-resolution thermal constellation, and explore domestic manufacturing and operation. IHI is also collaborating with ICEYE for SAR satellites, with plans to launch the constellation starting in 2026.",
  "why_it_matters": "This partnership strengthens Japan’s sovereign Earth observation capabilities, aligning with national security and economic priorities amid rising geopolitical tensions. It also highlights international collaboration under the UK-Japan Hiroshima Accord and expands IHI’s multi-sensor constellation strategy.",
