  "summary": "Japan’s IHI has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with UK-based SatVu to explore adding thermal imaging satellites to IHI’s planned Earth observation constellation. The partnership aims to evaluate applications of thermal data in Japan, define requirements for a sovereign high-resolution thermal constellation, and explore domestic satellite construction and operation. IHI is also collaborating with ICEYE for SAR satellites, but this deal specifically involves SatVu for thermal imaging.",
  "why_it_matters": "This partnership strengthens Japan’s sovereign Earth observation capabilities, aligning with national security and economic priorities. It also reflects deeper UK-Japan collaboration under the Hiroshima Accord, highlighting the strategic importance of thermal infrared data for defense and emerging technologies.",
