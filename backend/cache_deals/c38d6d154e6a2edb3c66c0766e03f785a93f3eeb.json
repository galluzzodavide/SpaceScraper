  "summary": "A consortium of Ukrainian, Nordic, and Eastern European companies plans to raise over 100 million euros to build a constellation of 70+ imagery satellites (Intermarsat) to reduce reliance on U.S. intelligence. The project aims to secure private funding by 2026 and achieve full operational capability by the end of the decade. ICEYE is mentioned as a key ally but is not directly involved in this specific fundraising or constellation initiative.",
  "why_it_matters": "The initiative reflects a strategic shift toward regional autonomy in space-based intelligence, driven by concerns over U.S. policy changes and the need for independent surveillance capabilities in Eastern Europe and Nordic countries threatened by Russia.",
