  "summary": "The article discusses a report by the European Space Policy Institute and Aerospace Corporation’s Center for Space Policy and Strategy that examines how the U.S. and Europe define and use commercial space procurement. It highlights the ambiguity around the term 'commercial' in space programs, noting differences in procurement cultures and risk-sharing between governments and industry. The report categorizes commercial procurement into 'Commercial-Lite,' 'Commercial-Led,' and 'Purely Commercial' efforts, warning that unclear definitions may lead to mismatched expectations and inefficient program design.",
  "why_it_matters": "The article underscores the need for clearer definitions and alignment between policy goals and contract structures in commercial space procurement to avoid misjudging outcomes and overstating market-driven approaches in government space programs.",
