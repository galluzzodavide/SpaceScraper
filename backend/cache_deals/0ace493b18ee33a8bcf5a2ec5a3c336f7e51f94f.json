  "summary": "BlackSky and Iceye have partnered with Aechelon Technology and Niantic Spatial to create Project Orbion, a digital twin of Earth. The project aims to merge satellite imagery and data from multiple sources into a frequently updated geospatial model. BlackSky and Iceye will contribute high-resolution imagery and synthetic aperture radar data, respectively, while Aechelon and Niantic provide AI-driven visualization and 3D simulation technologies. The first test will support the U.S. Coast Guard Aviation Training Center.",
  "why_it_matters": "This partnership establishes a collaborative framework for integrating diverse geospatial data sources into a unified, frequently updated digital twin of Earth. It could set new standards for geospatial data sharing and enable applications in wildfire monitoring, military targeting, and mission-critical training. The involvement of ICEYE and BlackSky highlights the growing importance of commercial satellite data in enterprise and government solutions.",
