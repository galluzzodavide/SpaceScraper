  "summary": "BlackSky and Iceye have partnered with Aechelon Technology and Niantic Spatial to create Project Orbion, a digital twin of Earth. The project aims to merge satellite imagery and data from multiple sources into a frequently updated geospatial model. BlackSky and Iceye will contribute high-resolution visual imagery and synthetic aperture radar data, respectively, to Aechelon’s Skybeam database. The first test will involve providing 3D scanning and simulation technology to the U.S. Coast Guard Aviation Training Center.",
  "why_it_matters": "This partnership establishes a collaborative framework for integrating diverse geospatial data sources into a unified, frequently updated digital twin of Earth. It has applications in wildfire monitoring, military targeting, and mission-critical training, potentially setting new standards for geospatial data sharing and communication.",
